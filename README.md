### Custom Software Solutions in C++ & Python

I build software that gets the job done. Specializing in C++ and Python, I create custom solutions for specific problems.
I started coding in 2020 and have been focused on writing clean, practical code ever since. I'm currently taking on custom projects whether you need a system utility, a desktop application, or tools to automate your workflow.

## Technical Focus

*   Languages: C++, Python.
*   Tools: GCC/G++, Visual Studio.

## Get In Touch

Have a project in mind? Let's discuss what we can build together.
